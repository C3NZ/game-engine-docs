A generic buffer element representation to be used in conjuction with Buffer\+Layouts. 

The creation of every buffer is logged if L\+A\+M\+B\+D\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+V\+E\+L\+O\+P\+M\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DE is enabled at compile time of of the engine. (Will disable in the future, but currently still testing.) 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
