\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This is a utility file that is primarily used for debugging the internals of the engine when incorrect behavior or invalid use of the A\+PI is occurring. 

This should most likely not be deployed into any game extending this engine. L\+A\+M\+B\+D\+A\+\_\+\+E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+A\+S\+S\+E\+R\+TS enables and disables assertions for both the client and the engine at compile time.
