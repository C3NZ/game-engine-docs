This repo is for learning how to structure and make a game engine! This repository is inspired by The Cherno\textquotesingle{}s game engine series and is especially reliant on the rendering engine that is implemented in Hazel. If you\textquotesingle{}d like to learn more about the awesome series, please check out the link to his channel \& series down below.

lambda on the other hand is my own take at a cross platform game engine that is is meant to be entirely free and easy to use. It is also for me to further my knowledge in C++.

\doxysubsection*{How to run/setup}

In order to get external dependencies that are needed in order to run the project, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/setup.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will initialize pre commit checks for development and also initialize all git submodules.

In order to build and run a release version of the sandbox that comes with the engine, you can simply run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/compile\_and\_run.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


In order to change the build, you can utilize\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/compile\_and\_run.sh -\/-\/build Debug}
\end{DoxyCode}


To learn more about what scripts offer, try passing --help into them like so\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/compile\_and\_run.sh -\/-\/help}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsection*{Documentation}

All documentation can be found at \href{https://engine-docs.cenz.io}{\texttt{ lambda-\/docs}}. Documentation is being written as the engine progresses, so it may currently lack behind what the engine is capable of.

All documentation is generated using doxygen. Feel free to contribute to areas of the codebase that currently don\textquotesingle{}t have documentation or dont use the majority style.

\doxysubsection*{Directory structure}

{\ttfamily lambda} -- The source code, dependencies, and assets for the lambda engine.

{\ttfamily docs} -- the documentation server and static content for lambda. Primarily used internally.

{\ttfamily tools} -- C++ tools that are made from the engine for testing it and experimenting with it\textquotesingle{}s potential.

{\ttfamily scripts} -- bash scripts used for automating tedious tasks. (Like compiling and running tools)

\doxysubsection*{Getting started}

\doxysubsubsection*{Support}

Currently only linux is being supported and hasn\textquotesingle{}t been tested on other platforms. A very useful type of contribution to this project would be to verify and potentially extend the current A\+PI to support as many platforms and graphics A\+P\+Is as possible, but getting lambda to work, be highly efficient, and be well thought out is the current plan to avoid as much technical debt as possible in the future.

\doxysubsubsection*{Building}

Currently, lambda is built using cmake. In order to add this to your own project that also was using cmake, you could use these commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# In your CMakeLists.txt file...}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(dependency\_dir/lambda)}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(your\_app lambda)}
\end{DoxyCode}


In the above example, {\ttfamily dependency\+\_\+dir} is where your dependencies and most likely lambda will be setting. This should be relative and below the cmake file (Like how lambda structures it\textquotesingle{}s dependencies.) {\ttfamily your\+\_\+app} should be the name of the executable that you\textquotesingle{}re trying to build.

Once that\textquotesingle{}s done, you should now be able to include $<$Lambda.\+h$>$ into your code and now should have access to the {\ttfamily lambda} namespace.

\doxysubsubsection*{Your first application}

There are two components that are required to know with hooking into Lambda.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Application
\item Layers
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The {\ttfamily Application} class within {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classlambda_1_1core_1_1Application}{lambda\+::core\+::\+Application}}} is what allows you to hook lambda in order for it to power all of your applications. By creating a a class that extends from {\ttfamily Application}, you\textquotesingle{}re provided with a set of functionality that allows you to automatically add {\ttfamily Layers} of code to the engine that do exactly what you need to do via {\ttfamily Push\+Layer(new Layer())}. Let\textquotesingle{}s look at a simple program that hooks into lambda and does exactly that\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include <Lambda.h>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include "Lambda/core/Entrypoint.h"}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Gives us access to CreateShared<Class T>(...);}
\DoxyCodeLine{// The engine rarely does work with raw pointers and unless you have good reason}
\DoxyCodeLine{// for doing so, neither should you!}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::memory::CreateShared;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Gives us access to Unique<Class T>, which is just a smart pointer at the}
\DoxyCodeLine{// moment (Will be changed in the future but should be used right now.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::memory::Unique}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Gives us access to Shared<Class T>, which is just a smart pointer at the}
\DoxyCodeLine{// moment (Will be changed in the future but should be used right now.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::memory::Shared;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Gives us access to the Application API}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::Application;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Gives us access to the generic layer API}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::layers::Layer;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{using lambda::core::util::TimeStep;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Our Layer to receive events and hook into the update loop within lambda. You}
\DoxyCodeLine{// can make as many layers as you like!}
\DoxyCodeLine{class HelloLayer : Layer \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  public:}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // Hook into Lambdas update loop!}
\DoxyCodeLine{    void OnUpdate(TimeStep delta) override \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      LAMBDA\_CLIENT\_LOG(}
\DoxyCodeLine{          "\{\} seconds since last update." delta<double>.InSeconds());}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // Hook into Lambda's event system!}
\DoxyCodeLine{    void OnEvent(Shared<Event> event) override \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Our Application instance. We can only ever instantiate one of these at a}
\DoxyCodeLine{// time! (Will fail if LAMBDA\_ASSERT\_ENABLES is true.)}
\DoxyCodeLine{class HelloLambda : public Application \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  public:}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // Push the HelloLayer into the Application. The layer and your logic now}
\DoxyCodeLine{    // have access to events and the update loop!}
\DoxyCodeLine{    HelloLambda() \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      PushLayer(CreateShared<HelloLayer>());}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Once you've created an application and a layer, you now have the ability to}
\DoxyCodeLine{// spin up your application with:}
\DoxyCodeLine{Unique<Application> lambda::core::CreateApplication() \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  return CreateUnique<HelloLambda>(); \}}
\end{DoxyCode}


And boom, this starter pack will get you on your feet and running! While this tutorial doesn\textquotesingle{}t cover the majority of the library, there will be more tutorials like this. Please refer to the documentation if need to figure out how to use the A\+PI. It is regularly updated.
