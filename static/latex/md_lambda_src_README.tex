This repo is for learning how to structure and make a game engine! This repository is inspired by The Cherno\textquotesingle{}s game engine series and is especially reliant on the rendering engine that is implemented in Hazel. If you\textquotesingle{}d like to learn more about the awesome series, please check out the link to his channel \& series down below.

lambda on the other hand is my own take at a cross platform game engine that is is meant to be entirely free and easy to use. It is also for me to further my knowledge in C++.

\doxysubsection*{How to run/setup}

In order to get external dependencies that are needed in order to run the project, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/setup.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will initialize pre commit checks for development and also initialize all git submodules.

In order to build and run a release version of the sandbox that comes with the engine, you can simply run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/compile\_and\_run.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


In order to change the build, you can utilize\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./scripts/compile\_and\_run.sh -\/-\/build Debug}
\end{DoxyCode}


It is to note that all scripts can be run from anywhere so long as the place you\textquotesingle{}re executing the command is within the repo.

\doxysubsection*{Documentation}

All documentation can be found at \href{https://engine-docs.cenz.io}{\texttt{ engine-\/docs}}. Documentation is being written as the engine progresses, so it may currently lack behind what the engine is capable of.

The documentation is currently going an overhaul and has not been updated as of being renamed to lambda.

\doxysubsection*{Live deployments}

This project may or may not be used in games, but will definitely be used to create my own unique rendering engine in the future.

\doxysubsection*{How to contribute}

Fork the current repository and then make the changes that you\textquotesingle{}d like to said fork. Upon adding features, fixing bugs, or whatever modifications you\textquotesingle{}ve made to the project, issue a pull request to this repository containing the changes that you\textquotesingle{}ve made and I will evaluate them before taking further action. This process may take anywhere from 3-\/7 days depending on the scope of the changes made, my schedule, and any other variable factors.
